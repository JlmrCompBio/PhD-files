Arthur:

OBSERVATIONS:
 - There are two compounds that increase ATP hydrolysis --> no explanation for this --> maybe the protein gets stucked in the outward conformation?
 - Using ketMD --> the most promising setup was substrate+Mg2+ATP for observing transitions
 - From papers: there are already some distances and descriptors defined --> iScience and ketMD papers
 - Do substrates have a characteristic binding pose?
   - Arthur's hypothesis form simulaionts:
     - Inhibitors --> orient perpendicularly to the transport axis
     - Substrates --> orient aligned with the transport axis
     - But, does this hold also in crystal structures?

TO DO:
  - Enhanced sampling for the substrate+Mg+ATP setup
  - Data base with substrates

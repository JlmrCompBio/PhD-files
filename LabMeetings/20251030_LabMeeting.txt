Arthur's presentation about ABCG2:

SO FAR:
- pdb: only inward facing when no substrate
- outward facing: ATP+Mg but also mutants --> which one is more important? --> probably ATP+Mg
- Simulations: 1 microsecond, no conf. change
- Two compounds increase ATPs activity, but still are inhibitors
    - ATP hydrolysis is actually the driving force for the opening


PROBLEMS:
- The expected effects happen when the protein changes the conformation
- No explanation for why the two compunds inhibit but still cause ATP hydrolysis

OPEN QUESTIONS:
- substrate --> characteristic binding mode?
  - Observations from simulations:
    - substrate --> vertical orientation
    - inhibitor --> horizontal orientation
  - In crystal structures too?
  

FROM PAPERS
- IScience: phenylalanine triade
  - also some general descriptors --> Arthur idea: use them to evaluate the effect of the different ligands.


PROPOSALS:
- Kinetically enhanced MD (ketMD)
  - to sample the transition: substrate + ATP + Mg2+
- Maybe the protien is stucked in the outward facing conformation?
